You're probably thinking about your future, trying to figure out how to land a job in tech, and finally start building the life you actually want. Everyone around you keeps saying the same thing. Go to college, get a degree, then maybe you'll land a decent job one day. Well, here's the truth. You don't need to be a genius, and you definitely don't need to waste four years and pile up student debt to start a career in tech. That's exactly why I want to tell you about something that flipped the game. Triple 10. Triple 10 isn't just another coding boot camp. It's a career launcher. They help real people, even if you're starting from zero. Break into tech with beginner-friendly programs in software engineering, data analytics, quality assurance, cyber security, and other high demand careers that don't require a computer science degree, or years of experience. And the best part, you get to work on real projects with real companies. So your resume doesn't scream, ""I took 10 random online courses and still don't know what I'm doing."" Yeah. And because of that, 82% of their graduates get hired within six months with a median salary of $70,000. That's more than a lot of people with fancy degrees ever make. But if you don't land a job within 10 months, you get all your money back. It's 100% online. You can learn on your own time. And no, you don't need to sell a kidney to afford it because it starts from only $200 per month.

So, what's wild about this episode is that while it technically takes place one day before the events of The Last of Us Part Two, most of these scenes are in fact from the game. We just see them in flashbacks much further into the game. We start off right where we left off at the end of season 1 with Ellie confronting Joel about the truth behind what happened to the Fireflies, and he is standing firm in his lie. And then we move on to a scene that is new to this series. The remaining Fireflies are burying the dead that Joel left behind in a mass grave. The first thing we focus on are the giraffes, the same ones that Joel and Ellie saw right before everything went south. Now, in this scene, the symbolism is flipped for Abby as she watches them eating leaves next to her father's fresh grave. So, for Ellie and Joel, these giraffes were a symbol of peace and hope despite the endless tragedies of the apocalypse. But for Abby, they will forever serve as a reminder of her greatest loss. We can see the Firefly dog tags hanging on the crosses while the team discusses their next move. At one point, Abby mentions something about Ellie's immunity, and Norah responds with something not true because it isn't possible. So, this implies that there wasn't even a consensus among the Fireflies on whether or not her immunity was real. And then Owen suggests heading to Seattle to meet someone named Isaac, referring to Isaac Dixon, the leader of the Washington Liberation Front. This sounds important. Well, yeah. The WLF or Wolves as they call themselves is a paramilitary group that successfully overthrew Fedra and now uses its military assets to control its territory. They're the ones who take in the Salt Lake crew and supply them for a run at Joel, which is precisely the move that we see Owen convince Abby and their crew to make here. Then she suggests that when we kill him, we kill him slowly. And this line is in here to vilify the character, who's kind of right, but they don't want her to sound too right because she's the villain. Wait, what do you mean? Doesn't she want to kill Joel? Well, look, this is pretty controversial in the Last of Us fandom, but I think she's pretty justified here, Doug. I mean, look at the field of bodies that Joel left behind. Not only did he take out humanity's best shot at a cure, but he's essentially taken out the fireflies entirely. He eradicated some of the best doctors in the world, people who could have saved countless lives. If there were a trolley dilemma situation here, undoubtedly Joel should be the one to go for the sake of everyone else. Aby's revenge may be motivated by the loss of her father. But in doing so, she's more than justified in her actions. If anything, this episode shows how much of a villain Joel really is and how his whole good guy narrative is just something he's convinced himself that he is. But this scene in particular shows that he is very much not the hero that he thinks that he is. Now, after that, we move into the intro, which is the same as season 1 with some minor hue shifts. Many of the warmer colors we saw in the first season intro are replaced with the cooler, less saturated colors, likely due to this season primarily taking place in the cold, frozen winter. Or at least that's what I'm told by Doug since I am color blind. I personally I'm color blind. So you'll notice everyone in Jackson has a job and a role to fulfill in their community. Now, unfortunately, careers don't work like that in the real world. Most of us are more like Ellie. We're unsatisfied in our jobs and we're looking for change. Like for instance, my job's got me so stressed out. Nothing is ever good enough. And when you succeed, they just give you more to do. And now they're laying people off. And I just know AI is coming. Everybody Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Just breathe. But I don't have lungs. Listen, man. We can relate to everything you just said. And we have all felt undervalued at work. And I definitely struggle with my own work life balance. Yeah, I mean, we haven't left the store in 5 years. Yeah. And that fear of getting laid off is real, man. So, if you want some life flexibility and financial independence, try Triple 10, the sponsor of this video. Triple 10 is an online platform for tech education. They're great for everyone who wants to change something in their career. They offer online boot camps with one of the highest graduation and employment rates in the industry. 82% of their grads get hired in 6 months or less. And the median salary of a triple 10 graduate is $72,000 a year. Oh, well, I don't know anything about that tech stuff. That's okay because they offer beginnerfriendly boot camps and you do not need to have a tech background. Plus, the lessons are flexible and they are tailored to people like you who have busy schedules. With Triple 10, you can learn a new profession that offers you financial independence, a better work life balance, and can change your life. And if it takes you more than 10 months to get a job that you trained for, you get 100% of your money back. This is a great opportunity for you to take control of your life and jump into a tech career that an AI cannot replace. Yeah, I think I'm going to give that triple 10 a try.

And I remember when I was in grad school to learn to do socioetics, I had to learn coding by myself from scratch. I had dusty old books on Unix. I learned base R from a statistics professor at Wharton teaching a massive class with almost no feedback. And I had to cluge together a Python education from whatever books and online tutorials I could scrge together. At one point I spent over five hours doing something that I could have done in 10 minutes with a for loop. It was awful. I'm certain I still write suboptimal code and I still have gaps in my skill set. I wish I'd had something like Triple 10 when I was starting. Triple 10 is a platform for online education where you can get a tech education and jump into tech. Triple 10 offers flexible, beginner-friendly online boot camps with one of the highest graduation and employment rates in the industry. It's the only boot camp in the US that provides unlimited externship opportunities even after graduation. 82% of their grads get hired in 6 months or less, making more than an adjunct professor. No, really. The median salary for one of their grads is $70,000 a year, and the median for an adjunct professor of linguistics is $60,000 according to Google. But anecdotally, it's not even that in recent years. Triple 10 offers a 100% money back guarantee if it takes more than 10 months after completing your program to get the job you train for. And they give their students projects with real companies for work experience. Not only that, but it's flexible learning you can tailor to your busy schedule or your existing job while you're trying to level up your skills for a better job.

If you do get laid off or you've recently been laid off, I think the biggest like crazy thought concern is what the heck am I going to do next? You know, you had your whole life in this this job and then one day you wake up and it's gone. And that's hard to like wrap your head around. I mean, let's be real for a second. Layoffs are becoming way too common. One day you're grinding it out at your nineto-ive and the next you're handed a box and you've been told your position has been eliminated. I've seen too many people, and I'm talking smart, hardworking people, get let go without warning. And with AI and automation moving fast, job security is just not what it used to be. That's why I want to tell you guys about something that actually helps. Triple 10 is an online tech boot camp that helps people switch careers and get into stable, high-paying fields. No tech background required. 82% of their grads get hired within 6 months of finishing the program. And if you don't get hired within 10 months, they'll give you your money back. Seriously. What I really love is that Tripleton doesn't just teach you how to code. They've got programs for other in- demand tech careers and they actually partner with real companies so you get realworld project experience. And if you're not sure about coding, they have non-coding programs, too, like user experience and user interface design. So, if you're feeling stuck, burned out, or you just want a job that's futurep proof and remote friendly, check out Tripleton. You can start learning for as low as $200 a month.

I think a lot of people reach a point where their job doesn't line up with what they want to do long term. Whether that's stability, flexibility, or just doing something that feels relevant. That's why I genuinely like what Triple 10 is doing. It's an online boot camp that's made for those who need a flexible schedule. Their programs are flexible, beginner-friendly, and designed to get you actually working in tech with no tech background needed. Triple 10 has beginner-friendly online boot camps teaching things like software engineering and UX design with one of the highest graduation and employment rates in the industry. And it's the only boot camp in the US that provides unlimited externship opportunities even after graduation. 82% of their grads get hired in under 6 months. And if you don't, they give you your money back. They even keep letting you do these externship programs after you graduate to continue getting more experience. If you're looking to make a career change to find a job you didn't think you'd be able to, Triple 10 might be worth looking into. I've actually been really looking into software design for quite some time now, so I'm considering really doing this as well. You can get started for $200 a month, which is more affordable than traditional schooling, and I personally would have definitely paid to at least get into my current desk job.

I used to work in retail and leisure management. The hours were long, the salary was not great and the appreciation was minimal. In fact, it was so bad that I was working 60hour weeks, only getting paid for 40 hours, and barely seeing my newborn daughter. It almost broke me, to be honest. I would have done anything to have something like today's sponsor, Triple 10, back then. Triple 10 is the platform where you can get a tech education and then jump into tech. It's very beginner friendly with flexible learning, tailored to busy schedules, and compatible with office work. Triple 10 teaches professions and helps people change their lives and thrive in the world of technology. 82% of grads get hired within 6 months of completing their program. And they've got to get a job or get a 100% money back guarantee. The salaries in tech are good as well. A median salary of a triple 10 graduate is $70,000. Be confident in your future.

Laptop open, work half finished. And then it hits you. You're overworked, underpaid, and no matter how much you do, it never feels like enough. As if that wasn't bad enough, you now have to worry about the layoffs and AI taking your job. Living expenses only keep getting worse, and it feels like there's nothing you can do about it. You've been watching tutorial after tutorial, but everyone is just trying to sell you their magic course with different methods and strategies, all promising results with no actual guarantee that any of it will work. You don't have to feel like this anymore. You can take control of your life and switch to a career that will give you the life of your dreams. And if you feel like you need help, you can take a closer look at Triple 10, the sponsor of today's episode. Triple 10 is an online education platform that helps people transition careers into tech without any prior experience or expensive degree required. The programs are flexible, beginnerfriendly, and designed to give you the best chance at landing a tech job. And it works. Around 82% of graduates get hired within just 6 months with a median salary of $70,000. And if you don't land a job within 10 months of finishing your program, you get 100% of your money back. It's honestly a no-brainer. They also offer unlimited externships with real companies, so you can keep building hands-on experience even after graduation. In a world full of empty promises from charlatans and fake gurus, Triple 10 teaches you the business skills that actually last. The ones that are in demand now and will remain relevant into the next decade, even with AI. If you're feeling stuck, maybe it's time to choose something better.

But you know what's even weirder? The fact that you watch so much tech content, you could probably be a pro in the field, yet you aren't working in the tech industry. Well, if that's you, listen closely because I might just have the solution here that you're looking for, which starts with Tripleton, who is the sponsor of today's video. Triple is a platform where you can get a tech education and real project experience from companies, no matter what your background is. Now, when you think of tech, you probably think of coding, right? Well, here's the thing. While you can get into coding through Tripolin with some of their programs like data science and cyber security, you can also go through their business intelligence analytics or UX and UI design programs without having to code at all. And the curriculum, it's not stuck in the past. It's constantly updated to match what employers are actually looking for, including tools powered by AI. The tech world evolves fast, and Triple 10 makes sure that you're always learning the skills that actually matter. And here's where it gets good. The median salary of a graduate is $70,000. 82% of grads get hired within 6 months of completing the Triple 10 program. A lot of these jobs allow for remote work, and they even have alumni working for companies like PlayStation and Discord. And best of all, they guarantee you get 100% of your money back if you don't find a job in 10 months after completing your course.

I took half of her influencer fortune in the divorce. My plunger business took off. The factory was running at full tilt. I was drowning in money, throwing parties for clients every night. Sad part was I was never happy. Didn't matter how great I was, I still could not get any code done in Python. My stylist recommended I take a career quiz with Triple 10. I spent some of my money and did a boot camp. They provided so many options for me to take back my life and to start new. I took consultations with their career coaches. And I now have more opportunities for employment after I finish the program. And while I don't need a job, 82% of triple tendon grads get hired in six months or less.

You ever stop and think with all the tech videos you've been watching that maybe it's time to go from watching to actually doing? Seriously, if you've ever caught yourself researching specs for fun, comparing GPUs at 2 a.m., or explaining draw distance to your console gamer friends, you're already halfway there. So, why not take it further? Now, maybe you're thinking it's too late, or I don't have the money or background to make that kind of change. But what if I told you there's a way to start learning real in- demand tech skills without quitting your job or taking on a ton of debt? That's where today's sponsor, Triple 10, comes in. They offer beginnerfriendly, flexible online boot camps that help people transition into tech. No experience required. 82% of their grads land jobs in tech within 6 months. And if it takes longer than 10 months, you get your money back, so there's nothing to lose. With real projects from real companies and unlimited externships, even after graduation, you won't just learn, you'll do. Say goodbye to layoffs and hello to skills that last. Because Triple 10 teaches how to adapt AI into your work as well, making you a specialist with an advantage. Ready to change your life?

It always seemed like the risk of trying new things was too great and too expensive to make it worth my while. And so I felt trapped, too scared to explore new opportunities, but too safe to build the life I truly wanted. Ultimately, it was a leap of faith which set me down the right path as I discovered my passion for movies and making videos, which eventually led to creating this channel. I believe everyone deserves to find their passion in life, and so do you, which is why I'd like to introduce you to Triple 10. They offer a free career quiz that can help you take the first step to finding what truly inspires you. Unlike many university courses which land you in decades of student debt and no job, Tripleton graduates have a staggering 82% employment rate within 6 months of graduating, as well as a median salary of $70,000. Tripleton offers beginner friendly boot camps with flexible payment options and career support on your resume and interviews. They even provide a 100% money back guarantee if you don't get a job that you train for within 10 months of graduating. Combined with her flexible schedules tailored to accommodate your busy everyday life, you don't have to put your current job or studies aside in order to make time.

I was a high school dropout playing copious amounts of games who just Googled how to make videos. I'm still completely selftaught, but honestly, I could have saved so much time and stress if I had done some kind of editing boot camp. The only thing I did have was the feeling that this was something I actually cared about. And it turns out with enough passion, it didn't matter if I had a degree. What did matter is actually getting started. That's why I love what Triple 10, the sponsor of today's video, is doing. It's a platform that helps people switch into tech without needing prior experience or fancy background. 82% of their grads get hired within 6 months of completing the program. That's like most of the grads. You know what I mean? But I get it. You're busy grinding relevant AAA game in current year. Well, don't worry. They have flexible learning schedules tailored for goblins just like you. If you don't get the job you train for after 10 months, they will literally give you your money back. That's how arrogant these guys are. It's unbelievable. And if you're not into coding, just take a look at their design course instead. Listen, it's time to start doing something you actually liked.

You know that feeling when you're planning out your week and you realize you basically are just scheduling around a job that does not really fulfill you? Like you're pushing dinner with your friends to 8:30 because you might have to stay late even though nobody asked you to. Or you find yourself labeling your Sunday as buffer time, not for rest, but just to emotionally recover from your job before Monday hits. I can recommend a tool that can help you take the first step towards change, and it's Triple 10, who is sponsoring today's video. Triple 10 is a platform that helps people with different life paths make a pivot in their career with beginnerfriendly boot camps. And here's what really caught my attention. You don't need any tech background to get started. They designed their programs to work around your current schedule. So, you can literally be planning your career change in the same planner you're using for your full-time job. Just don't let your boss see it.

And they're so confident in their program that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if it takes longer than 10 months to land a job. Plus, there are careers that offer the remote flexibility that so many of us are craving.

So, these four archetypes, right? These are all profiles of people who actually want more from their work, right? More freedom, more meaning, more flexibility, and let's be real, uh probably more money. Whether you're craving independence to build your own thing, creativity to actually enjoy what you do, or stability in knowing that you're like in a futurep proof field, tech careers often check those boxes. And you're probably sitting there right now being like, ""Okay, that's cool, Crystal. Yeah, tech careers. What the how the hell am I supposed to even start?"" Okay, that's where Triple 10 comes in. Triple 10 is a platform that helps you shift into a tech career, even if you have zero experience in tech. Their boot camps are flexible, beginner friendly, and unlike most programs, they don't actually just teach you skills and pat you on the back and wish you luck. They match you with real projects with real companies. So, by the time you graduate, you have actual experience under your belt. 82% of their graduates get hired within 6 months. And if you don't, you get 100% of your money back. It's literally like anti- college. Like all of the learning of college, but minus any of the risk of being a barista till you're 30 years old. Okay? And it's not just coding. Triple 10 has paths in data, product analytics, and QA.

Trapped in a system that doesn't feel like it's yours. A job that doesn't spark anything. A career path that just happened. If that resonates, you should seriously check out Triple 10. It's an online boot camp that helps you pivot into tech industry. You don't need a degree. You don't need to know how to code. No matter what the system tries to tell you, switching careers isn't magic. But it does take some effort. The one thing holding most people back, though, is the willingness to face uncertainty. And in my opinion, that's where Triple 10 shines. Triple 10 removes a lot of that uncertainty. The numbers speak for themselves. 82% of graduates land job in the tech industry within 6 months and the median salary of the triple 10 graduates is 70 grand. You can work from anywhere. You can choose your hours. And the thing is that if you don't find a job in 10 months, you get your money back. They teach you about the history. Here's what the concept looks like. From there, here is a labbased setup where you can practice the skill. You have tutors. You have other students that you're working with. So, you're never really alone.

Снимать фильмы, создавать контент, вести этот канал – это действительно привилегия. Но интернет постоянно меняется. Даже эта платформа, потому что алгоритмы меняются, платформы развиваются. И в глубине души я чувствую тихий страх, о котором уже несколько раз вам рассказывал. Что, если однажды это просто перестанет работать? Потому что такова жизнь. И это страшно. Жизнь – штука страшная. Она заставляет задуматься о будущем, о долгосрочной безопасности и о том, что на самом деле означает финансовая независимость в цифровом мире, который никогда не стоит на месте. Вот почему я рад представить вам сегодняшнего спонсора – Triple 10. Отличный вариант для всех, кто думает о будущем. Triple 10 – это онлайн-лагерь, который помогает людям освоить онлайн-технологии даже без опыта. Вам не нужно быть гением программирования. Программа подходит для новичков и достаточно гибкая, чтобы подстроиться под ваш график. Независимо от того, совмещаете ли вы работу, семью или фитнес-цели, как и я, это гораздо важнее семьи. Нет, вы понимаете, о чём я. Вот в чём загвоздка. 82% выпускников программы «Три десятки» находят работу в течение 6 месяцев. А если вас не возьмут через 10 месяцев, вы получите свои деньги обратно. Без шуток. И Грег использует слова, похожие на «выпускники». Ещё лучше: после выпуска они предлагают неограниченные возможности стажировки. Так что вы постоянно приобретаете реальный опыт. А во время программы вы будете работать над реальными проектами. Вы выпустите портфолио, которое поможет вам выделиться. Это практично. Это реально. И это может стать первым шагом к более стабильной и перспективной карьере. Так что, если вы похожи на меня и… Вы когда-нибудь задумывались о том, что ждет меня в будущем, и это может быть вашим знаком.

I had illness anxiety and a constant state of dread. I would dissociate sometimes for no reason at all. I would wake up at 3am with just a sense of heaviness. But then I changed a few very critical things in my life. I stopped couch rotting in front of the TV. I finished grad school, I switched careers, and I moved to Europe. I didn't like the direction my life had taken, so I changed it. And I know from many of your comments that it's not easy to start over. If you feel like you want more, more confidence, more freedom, more control, I want you to know that it is possible. And that's why I'm excited to share something that could help you take that first step.

I love this one because it actually gives you a roadmap on what to do, not just a bunch of random videos. You pick a path among different high-demanded tech professionals, and you learn by doing real projects from real companies to build yourself a real portfolio that'll land you interviews. Triple 10 also helps you with the interview process and provide online externship opportunities even after graduation. It's not hype. It is a proven shortcut if you use it right. Top employers like Google and Discord have hired out of Triple 10's bootcamp. Power-up number four, you need to get a credit card in your teens. Most schools won't tell you this, but your credit age matters more than the cash on hand. You want to start young, pay on time, and that is how you're going to build a credit score that gets you free flights, hotel upgrades, lower car insurance, and access to real estate faster. But as we know, to maintain a good credit score, you actually need to repay your loans. But in reality, that's much harder to do, especially if you have a massive loan like from your university or college. Triple 10 offers flexible payment options that makes it one of the more accessible alternatives in the market. You can start learning there for around $200 a month. And if you don't find a job within 10 months after completing the course, you can get 100% of your money back.

The job market feels absolutely cooked right now. All this talk about AI replacing jobs and the insane predictions about how many future jobs don't even exist yet can make you think, why even try? This is where Triple 10 comes in. It's a platform for online education that offers flexible, beginner-friendly boot camps. What makes Triple 10 especially relevant right now is that they actually teach you how to work with relevant AI tools rather than be replaced by them. Their programs are built to make you competitive in today's job markets, not the one from five years ago. And even if you're not sure that coding is for you, they also offer other career tracks like UI UX design where you don't need to code at all. 82% of their grads get hired within six months, which is crazy. And if it takes more than 10 months after completing your program to get the job you signed up for, they will give you 100% of your money back. Yeah. With a median salary of $70,000, it seems like a no-brainer to go through one of their programs if you've been struggling to secure a stable job.

Everyone wants to get a high-paying job in tech, but realistically, it'll take a lot of work, a lot of outside guidance, and a lot of hands-on experience to get you there. Luckily, Triple 10 gives you all of that. Even if you don't have tech experience, you can, from the comfort of your own home, rely on Triple 10 to give you courses, projects, externships, and coaching, all in a flexible schedule so you can finish all of it even if you're working a job right now. You can pick any career path from their seven options, including AI automation, UX UI design, cyber security, and data science, not just coding. The job placement rate is 82% within just six months of graduating the boot camp, and they guarantee that if you don't find a job within 10 months of graduating, you get a 100% refund. The way I see it, a small investment in your ability to make a higher salary works out to be a much better return than anything you could get from the stock market.

My brother was working this real nice paying tech job with flexible hours and some work-from-home days, too, and I was stuck commuting to work, working in a small little dungeon room, and then commuting back home. So I dove into free computer science courses online, picked up some C, JavaScript, and some Python, and after six months, I felt like I was going nowhere. I didn't have any guidance, structure, or even assurance that I was going down the right path. TripleTen is an online bootcamp platform that helps people change careers and get a job in the world of technology. And the best part? It's beginner-friendly, so you don't even need a tech background.

And if you don't get hired within 10 months of graduation, they'll refund 100% of your tuition. That's how confident they are that their program is going to work. And unlike other bootcamps, they've got your back even after they've taken your money. You can't say that about most companies. And it's not just coding. TripleTen offers career paths in AI and machine learning, cybersecurity, UX UI design, business intelligence analytics, AI automation, and more.

No benefits, no safety nets, just kind of hoping that everything balances out. What if there was a way to keep that freedom but also have a career you can actually count on long term? Well that's where today's video sponsor comes in, Triple Ten. Triple Ten is an online bootcamp that helps people break into tech even if you've never touched a line of code before. You don't have to be some computer whiz, they make it really beginner friendly and you can learn at your own pace around your existing life, work, kids, side hustles, or basically whatever else you've got going on. And here's what really stood out to me, 82% of their students land a job in tech within 6 months. And if you don't they literally refund your tuition if you haven't gotten a job in 10 months. That's pretty much how much they back their program, plus it's not just about sitting through lessons, while you're learning you're building actual projects you can put into a portfolio. And after you finish they keep giving you externship opportunities you can stack up even more real world experience, which is a huge deal when you're trying to stand out to employers. So if you're tired of feeling stuck or worrying about what your future might look like this is one way to build security.

Triple 10 is a platform that allows you to get a technical education and actually get the job that you wanna land. UI, UX, AI development, cybersecurity, QA, so much more.

You don't need to be a tech genius or an engineer to join this new wave. There are already bootcamps that are designed to help people learn exactly these skills, even if you're starting from scratch. Programs like those offered by Triple 10, for example, who I've partnered with on today's video and who are a part of Nibia's group, the leader among AI infrastructure providers. And if you're new to Triple 10, this is an online tech bootcamp that helps people switch into IT and data careers. And they're now teaching professionals from all backgrounds how to design and implement automations that make real impact in marketing and business operations and customer experience and lots of others. In fact, they have a course on AI automation that is suitable for complete beginners as well as for those who want to implement AI, whether in their current business or in their job to level up and keep being relevant in the market. Because the truth is, you don't necessarily need to know how to code to understand automation. You just need the right framework, the right mentorship, and hands-on learning path. And that's because AI has moved beyond task automation. It is now cognitive automation. It writes code. It handles customer support. It manages entire business workflows from intake to delivery. We are actually watching the birth of a digital workforce that never forgets and never waits for somebody else's permission. And I think Gartner said that by 2026, four out of five companies will rely on AI-driven automation to run their operations. And there's something that I found really fascinating in this Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute research, where they found that workers actually want this. They're not afraid of AI. They wanted to handle the repetitive stuff so that they can focus on creative and strategic work that they do best. The fear is not automation replacing us. The fear is not learning how to work with it. But with programs like the Triple 10 AI Automation course that I mentioned earlier, which is a four-month part-time program, you're able to learn exactly what we've been talking about. How to automate routine tasks and how to make work fly using AI tools for business operations. And what I really liked about their approach is that this course, this program is built for real life. You can learn while you're still working and it is designed for complete beginners, even if you feel you have no coding experience. The program is consistently rated among the top bootcamps in the world. I think on their website, I saw that it scores 4.8 out of 5 rating based on over 1,200 reviews from Course Report and Switch Up and Career Karma and some others. And actually, if you're not sure where to begin, which I know is the case for a lot of people, Triple 10 offers a free career consultation to help you find your direction. So you can click the link in the description to book that free consultation right now. So with all of that in mind, what does this actually mean for you and for me and for regular people? It means that right now there is an invisible workforce that is forming underneath every business. And the people who understand how to design those processes, they're the ones running the world, in my opinion, because automation is not just about saving time. It's about creating that compound leverage that I've talked about. Because when a system runs without the business owner or the employee or without you once, it runs without you forever. So while most people are still thinking like users and learning prompts and how to use tools, I believe a new class of professionals is learning how to design automations. And that's why Triple 10's AI automation course is, in my opinion, so well positioned. So as you come to your Triple 10 student platform, you'll be able to see your entire course overview at a glance. And I'll come back and walk you through all the modules and all the content step by step. But first, I really want to show you some very valuable features here in the left hand corner. So obviously here on the main page, you're going to see the course that you've signed up for, your progress and your structure. But then here on the left hand side, you have all the events. So you'll be able to see all the upcoming important milestones. And you're also able to add that to your schedule or your calendar. And you also have all the upcoming group office hours that you're able to join. And as you can see, no matter where you're from, they are held at different hours. So you should be able to find one that suits your schedule. Now, coming back to the course overview, the course is split into seven sprints. And a sprint takes two weeks, just like in real life. And the first sprint talks about AI tools and prompt engineering. The second one covers large language models. Sprint number three is about AI and automation. And then sprint four goes a bit deeper into advanced applications of AI. And sprint number seven is about your final project and your mock interview in a one-to-one session. And let me be very clear.
